# Question D1: market-cap-history

# D1: Please create a historical annual market cap dataset (from their inception 
# until the day youâ€™ve created it ) for the (US-listed) largest 10 companies:
# NVIDIA,Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, Berksire 
# Hathaway, and TSMC.

# You can use this look  at this site (https://companiesmarketcap.com/) or their
# indivdual websites for the data. 

# You can place your dataset in a github repository or some other website (as
# soon as your nodebook can read it, that is good enough)

# Please plot their indexed annual market cap growth. The "Indexed" is defined 
# the first year market cap is 100 all of the companies.

# For example, this is what I got for my "Indexed" annual market cap growth.
